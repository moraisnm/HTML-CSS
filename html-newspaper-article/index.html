	<p>The hygge lifestyle can be for anyone and everyone — you just have to prioritize comfort. Your house should feel
		like a home, not cold and detached. When you extend your comfort to the outdoors, you build a space that offers
		several benefits and makes you feel right at home on your property.
	</p>
	<h3>What Is Hygge?</h3>
	</a>Hygge, a Danish word pronounced “hyoo-gah,” is a lifestyle that embraces coziness and the calm of life. You want
	to feel comfortable in your own home, and following a <a
		href="https://blog.smartfurniture.com/what-does-it-mean-to-live-a-hygge-lifestyle/">[hygge lifestyle] </a> will
	let you relax — no more worrying about what other people may think about you or your home. You want your home to be

	<h3>Why Being Outdoors Is Great For You</h3>
	<p>Since you want to use every part of your home, you should ensure that your backyard is hospitable and makes you
		want to spend time outside. Being out in the sunlight can trigger physical growth and development, and it also
		plays a part in regulating your mental health. Spending time outside is directly linked to better physical and
		mental well-being. When you build a cozier outdoor space that becomes your hygge, you can enjoy every moment
		outside.</p>
	<h3>How to Level Up Your Backyard</h3>
	<p>You don't need the fanciest gadgets to have a backyard that invites people in. Just prioritize coziness and
		you’ll draw people to your home. Your backyard is part of your home, so you should strive to make it as
		comforting as every other area of your home.</p>
	<h4>Hang Up Warm Lights</h4>
	<p>Adding lighting to your outdoor areas can make them feel cozier than before. Instead of relying on one main light to illuminate your space, you can make your whole space feel homier with several softer lights. Using more energy-efficient, quality lighting can even lower your energy use by almost 70%. In addition to saving money on your energy bills, you’ll have a cozy backyard that welcomes family members and guests alike.</p>
